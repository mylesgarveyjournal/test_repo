Cannaverum — Starter Frontend

This is a minimal React app scaffolded to match the provided logo and brand direction.

Important: place your logo image file at `public/logo.png` (72-512px wide recommended).

Quick start:

1. npm install
2. npm start

Project structure:
- public/
- src/

The app uses only static JSON files under `src/data` and an API abstraction at `src/api/dataProvider.js` so it can be easily swapped with a cloud backend later.
